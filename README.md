# Command-Pilots-Prediction-for-Nonprofit
Build a prediction model to predict whether volunteer pilots will finish orientation and become command pilots for a nonprofit to allocate coordinators' resource more efficiently.

Angel Flight West (AFW) is a nonprofit that provides non-emergency medical air transportation for patients with financial constraints or other compelling needs. AFW delivers social impact with its platform where match volunteer pilots(supply) with patients(demand). In this project, I analyze the supply-side of the platform.

The following graph shows the journey of an AFW command pilot. Pilots need to register, complete command pilot orientation, and finally, fly a mission to be labeled “active”. Four pilot stages are investigated in our analysis and the definitions are as below. The percentages in blues represents conversion rates based on the data from 2018 to 2016. As you can see, there is 70% of pilots COULDN'T make through orientation. I have two goals in this project as the following.

1. Find the attributes that can be used to identify pilots who have higher chance to finish orientation and convert into command pilots so that marketing can adjust outreach strategies(Targeted-Markting)

2. Build prediction model to predict whether registered pilots will convert into command pilots so that AFW can allocate its limited resource to help these high potential pilots get through the orientation accordingly
